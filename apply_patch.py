apply_patch.py

Usage:
  python apply_patch.py patch_file.txt

This script parses a patch file in the custom format:
- File blocks start with: *** Add File: path/to/file
- Content lines are prefixed with '+'
- File blocks end with: *** End Patch

The script writes each file to disk, creating directories as needed.
For shell scripts with shebangs, it sets executable permissions on Unix systems.
